To install the AWS CLI on your Linux machine and configure it with AWS credentials, follow these steps:

### 1. Install AWS CLI Version 2

You can use the commands you provided, but I'll guide you through the steps with a bit more detail:

**Step 1: Download the AWS CLI installer**

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
```

This command downloads the AWS CLI version 2 installer to your current directory.

**Step 2: Unzip the installer**

```bash
unzip awscliv2.zip
```

This extracts the contents of the `awscliv2.zip` file.

**Step 3: Run the install script**

```bash
sudo ./aws/install
```

This command installs the AWS CLI. The `sudo` command is used to ensure you have the necessary permissions to install the software.

**Step 4: Verify the installation**

```bash
aws --version
```

This command should output the version of the AWS CLI that was installed, confirming that the installation was successful.

### 2. Configure AWS CLI with AWS Credentials

After installing the AWS CLI, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials:

**Step 1: Run the AWS configure command**

```bash
aws configure
```

You'll be prompted to enter the following details:

- **AWS Access Key ID**: Your AWS access key ID.
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: Your AWS secret access key.
- **Default region name**: The region you want to use by default (e.g., `us-west-2`).
- **Default output format**: The output format you prefer (e.g., `json`, `text`, or `yaml`).

Example:

```bash
AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```

**Step 2: Verify the configuration**

You can verify your configuration by running a simple AWS CLI command, like listing your S3 buckets:

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

If everything is configured correctly, this command will list your S3 buckets.

That's it! You've successfully installed and configured the AWS CLI on your Linux machine.
