# Why Use Terraform?

Terraform offers several advantages over other infrastructure management tools:

- **Manage Any Infrastructure**: Terraform can manage both low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.
- **Track Your Infrastructure**: Terraform keeps track of the current state of infrastructure through a state file. This allows you to see the changes made over time and ensures consistency.
- **Automate Changes**: Terraform automates infrastructure changes, reducing the risk of human errors and increasing efficiency.
- **Standardize Configurations**: Use reusable modules to standardize configurations across different environments.
- **Collaborate**: Terraform supports collaboration through remote backends, allowing teams to work together on infrastructure management.

### Why Terraform Over Other Tools?

- **Declarative Language**: Instead of writing scripts, you define your infrastructure's desired state.
- **Ecosystem**: A wide range of providers and modules to quickly deploy and manage infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Can be used for small projects to managing entire infrastructures.
- **Dry Run Support**: Terraform supports a `plan` command which allows you to preview changes before applying them.
