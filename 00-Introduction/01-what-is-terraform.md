# What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON.

Terraform allows you to manage and provision infrastructure across various cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and on-premises data centers.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Language**: Define your desired state of infrastructure and let Terraform manage the rest.
- **Provider-Agnostic**: Supports multiple providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and many more.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Enables you to version, share, and reuse your infrastructure configurations.
